# Letter - to interested parties (draft)

Whilst there's a fair bit of background work and related considerations, I've only just started - post IETF119 - working through the considerations.

The current repo where I'm uploading the notes: is https://github.com/WebCivics/HumanitarianICT  - it will be updated over the following week or so.  I have some underlying work that I've previously done in google docs, that i'm then working through converting and updating, into markdown files for the repo...  

I also have a broader series / body of works, pertaining to views or 'visions' of the useful purpose of humanitarian ict works, projects, peace infrastructure projects empowered by humanitarian ict - at large...

Perhaps, in the interim, between now and when i've documented the notions effectively enough to support cooperative collaboration better; there's an opportunity for others to also make considerations, with the view to forming decentralised results that may then form constituencies to the broader discussion and drafting process, for an effort, that i hope, may become something of meaningful benefit, for all members of our human family...  

noting; i have both formed a belief, that this initiative has merit; yet also, with all due humility any such endeavour deserves, find myself to be seeking to undertake a purposeful mission, feeling very humbled, with the greatest of desire to seek to effectively navigate through the process that i hope will act to deliver a positively employable instrument, without and undue or unintended consequences, to the greatest of my capacity; which means to me, that whilst i've initiated the notion, i hope to work through it, well, with others...  

in many ways, there are already a vast array of 'humanitarian ict' professionals; it's just that, there's not really a structure to legitimise, support, protect and strengthen the intended purposes; whilst seeking to form some sort of defensive structure to protect against unintended consequences and/or purposes, of the honourable efforts of the many existing and future, humanitarian technologists, support workers, products, services and infrastructure needs & requirements.  Most are not paid as 'humanitarian ict' professionals; and many who focus upon such areas of importance more exclusively, are often paid poorly, or not at all.  There are agency (terms in contracts) issues, that makes it difficult for honourable people to act honourably. Vulnerable 'consumers' are most often the cohort worst supported, even thought the consequences of these oversights can lead to substantive costs being incurred by others, as the flaws are known and then exploited by others on the basis that it is assumed there is a level at which accountability is made to be 'too hard', irraspective of the comprehensive 'pervassive survellience' capabilities, deployed generally, otherwise..

The lives of people, is not carried in folios, brief-cases or notebooks anymore; if a person has no access to 'fit and proper' digital records in a timely manner, there can be very serious consequences, that may well cause incurable harms, well before clarification of circumstances are then later able to be distinguished.  

I think our means to achieve SDGs, requires a means to better define Humanitarian ICT, and then go about supporting the growth of ICT.

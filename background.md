# Background
We have National Intelligence, foreign affairs capabilities, and defence capabilities. THis is then interwoven with large vendors in the ICT space. Often, workers seeking the ‘big bucks’ and in-turn companies seeking the ‘big contracts’ are engineering solutions specifically for these types of customers. Activities are performed in alignment with the needs of these critical state-based capabilities, but often yields what may be considered ‘authoritarian’ capabilities, lacking support for human rights.  As works have advanced, personhood has developed to incorporate both legal and technological structures, in various jurisdictions, leading to human beings in their natural / personal capacities, being defined as ‘consumers’ in many areas and laws.  

What does not exist is ‘departments of peace’ and related industries, save very limited historical structures, that are both strained and often not ‘fit for purpose’.  Whilst various efforts have sought to be developed, there is a lack of formal structure to adequately support the needs of ‘peace industries’, in a ‘competitive marketplace’.  This is believed to give rise to corruption problems, thought to be, broadly, a major issue.

Whilst there are existing ‘humanitarian organisations’, the vast majority of this infrastructure is historical and has not developed to better support ‘digital transformation’ challenges and opportunities.  This is evident by considering the advancements of ICT and what does exist, and indeed also, what does not.  There are countless examples of things that could better support ‘consumers’ that don't exist. There are also various systemic issues that disaffect our ability to remedy problems.

As a consequence of the very little support available for humanitarian ict work, in its truer, more honourable form, those engaged in various related areas are often engaged in making compromises that whilst sadly necessary, are not at all optimal.  

Areas where support is lacking include, but is not limited to, economic support alongside policy, and protective assistance, where and as needed; for this distinguished area of work, in a manner that does not incorporate immoral controls.

Humanitarian ICT is not of a kind that seeks to render long-term meaningful dependency of the lives of persons on any particular 3rd party service provider, vendor, product and moreover services. IT is not about locking the knowledge of humankind into any particular controlling entity, jurisdiction, language or group. It is not about forcing persons to compromise themselves morally, in-order to gain access to justice on any basis that acts, whether known or otherwise, to undermine our systems of justice by organisational designs; and diminish our capacity to advance our societies, our socioeconomics and our means to address real-world sociosphere and biosphere issues, in a timely manner with the least amount of resources delegated to acts of wrong-doing with particular concern to acts knowingly done to harm others; which is most often associated to gainful purposes, that should be auditable via ICT.

Further, the purpose of Humanitarian ICT is not to engender long-term rents upon the lives of ‘data subjects’ otherwise historically known, as members of our human family, to maximise profits; nor should Humanitarian ICT be expected to be done on or in conditions akin to modern slavery and/or in adversarially sustained environments of moral poverty without available lawful remedy or recourse; should not be done merely for the intents & purposes of profit or control; or as a means to engender some form of weapon or asymmetric protection benefiting the vendor without consideration for the rights of biosphere & related sociosphere tenants. 

Humanitarian ICT is an area or field of work, where the purpose is to produce derivatives that have meaningfully positive benefit, without immoral encumbrances.

A Humanitarian ICT Sector is considered to be not only a foundational requirement to establish our capacities to build supports for freedom, but also peace.

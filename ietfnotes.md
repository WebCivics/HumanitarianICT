# Introducing the Notion of Humanitarian ICT for a HotRFC (IETF) Session

This Topic will introduce the notion of Humanitarian ICT as a category of Peace Infrastructure, Peace infrastructure Projects and Emergent Peace Industry.  In-order to foster and support the development of Peace Infrastructure and our means to achieve SDGs, our capacity to define Humanitarian ICT, related infrastructure, services and workers is considered to be of instrumental importance for the future of digital transformation.

### Peace Infrastructure and Humanitarian Workers

Peace infrastructure refers to the institutions, mechanisms, and processes that contribute to the peaceful resolution of conflicts and the building of sustainable peace. It encompasses a wide range of entities, including international organizations, regional organizations, national governments, local authorities, civil society organizations, and the private sector.

Humanitarian workers are individuals who depend upon the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to support humanitarian operations. They may work for a variety of organisations, including international aid agencies, national governments, and local NGOs. 
There are four main categories of workers protected under international humanitarian law:
- **Medical and religious personnel**: This category includes doctors, nurses, paramedics, chaplains, and other religious workers.
- **Journalists**: Journalists are protected under international humanitarian law if they are engaged in professional duties and are not taking part in hostilities.
- **Humanitarian aid workers**: Humanitarian aid workers are protected under international humanitarian law if they are working for a recognized humanitarian organization and are not taking part in hostilities.
- **Civilian contractors**: Civilian contractors are protected under international humanitarian law if they are working for a military or government agency and are not taking part in hostilities.

Restrictions Required for a Person to Be Engaged in a Protected Activity as a Humanitarian Worker

In order to be engaged in a protected activity as a humanitarian worker, a person must meet the following criteria:
- They must be working for a recognized humanitarian organization.
- They must be impartial and not taking part in hostilities.
- They must have the necessary qualifications and experience to carry out their work.
- They must respect the principles of humanity, neutrality, and impartiality.
Humanitarian workers who meet these criteria are entitled to protection under international humanitarian law. This protection includes the right to be treated humanely, the right to freedom of movement, and the right to communicate with the outside world.  

### Defining Peace Infrastructure and Humanitarian ICT Workers

Humanitarian ICT workers play a vital role in providing information, communication, and other essential services to people affected by crises.  How can principles be applied to form supports for Humanitarian ICT Workers whose works are increasingly essential for all other humanitarian work.

The notion of defining ‘humanitarian ict’ is non-trivial.  The practice method requires means to form definitions in various fora including those pertaining to united nations efforts more broadly.  It also requires the means to define practical tools that can be used to support the notions described.
- Key Considerations
    - Define humanitarian ICT and means to define scope via Human Rights Instruments.
    - Highlight the unique challenges and opportunities of humanitarian ICT projects, works, deployments, maintenance and sustainability.
    - Discuss the importance of collaborative development of a humanitarian technical community and related supports.
    - How to Identify potential opportunities for standardisation & support the work.
    - Explore ways to ensure that humanitarian ICT is reliable, sustainable and scalable
    
Humanitarian ICT work is defined both by the objective purpose of the work, as well as the practice method and characteristics of its derivatives.  The scope of Humanitarian ICT works that can be performed is vast, as are the implications.  Humanitarian ICT work is considered to be a form of activity that relates to the creation, development & maintenance of Peace Infrastructure.

Humanitarian ICT work is primarily defined as work done to have the material effect of rendering support and protection for the human rights of persons and/or means through which we as fellow members of our human family may positively impact our biosphere & sociosphere via knowledge.

Humanitarian ICT work and infrastructure is considered to be increasingly instrumental for the protection and preservation of all rights, including but not limited to human rights and the means to support continuance of Humanitarian ICT projects needs to be made supportable at all times.

# HumanitarianICT
The Humanitarian ICT Project is about creating supports for Peace Infrastructure Projects, Infrastructure &amp; Industry.

## Call to Action - Define Humanitarian ICT

The purpose of this proposed, informational Internet Draft is to provide improved support for a ‘humanitarian ict’ sector.  An internet draft can be written and published via the IETF. Usually, an Internet Draft would be produced by a person who has the idea.  The notion of Humanitarian ICT is considered so substantive, that the preference is to do so with luminary minds, rather than solely as, what may be considered, a poorly minded ‘maverick’ method of accomplishing the task; as may otherwise be required.

The purpose of this inquiry is to seek out luminaries interested in helping to define, further betterment of humanity, the meaningful definition of Humanitarian ICT.  It should include consideration of the following;

1. Humanitarian ICT workers
2. Humanitarian ICT Segments

3. Work Segments
3.1 Infrastructure Segments
3.2 Software Segments
3.3 Hardware Segments
4. Humanitarian ICT Socio-Economics

This REPO contains some of the working docs, associated to the thoughtware development of this notion of a future humanitarian ict sector to support peace infrastructure projects.

# Humanitarian ICT - Definitions
International Humanitarian Law (IHL), also known as the law of armed conflict, outlines essential needs and protections for individuals affected by armed conflicts. This in-turn provides a foundation to establish the universal requirements needed by persons whether circumstances pertain to law during peacetime, or in relation to war.  The core principles of IHL are designed to alleviate human suffering and protect the dignity and well-being of those not taking part in hostilities. The essential needs of persons as defined by IHL include:

## Protection from Violence and Harm:
Civilians and other non-combatants must be protected from violence, including deliberate attacks on civilians, indiscriminate attacks, and attacks on civilian objects.

## Access to Medical Care:
Injured or sick individuals, regardless of their affiliation, have the right to receive medical care and assistance. Medical facilities and personnel must be respected and protected.

Individuals affected by conflict have the right to receive humanitarian assistance, including food, water, shelter, and other essential supplies. Humanitarian organisations must be allowed to provide assistance without undue obstacles.

## Protection of Civilians and Civilian Objects:

The aim is to provide a legal framework that balances the military necessities of conflict with the fundamental humanitarian needs of individuals.

## Areas of Work
Humanitarian ICT workers engage in a range of categories of work, that are constituencies of broader ‘peace infrastructure’.  It is believed that the means to define Humanitarian ICT workers will become part of the foundations for broader means to define international ‘peace industries’ via Humanitarian ICT workers.

Whereas; Humanitarian ICT workers contribute to the building of a just, inclusive, peaceful, and knowledge-based world by engaging in international collaboration in the fields of education, science, culture, and communication, activities and projects that have expressly peaceful purposes. When considering the scope of Humanitarian ICT work, Humanitarian ICT is illustrated in categories, thereby seeking to furnish a capacity to make definitions that may in-turn be supported by services.
